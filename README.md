# How to use

> Note: <br> You will have to have all your program files in the same directory as the python scripts in order to run them (or you can try adding the script directories to PATH and run them anywhere, but you can figure that out yourself)

`brf.py` is used to translate Brainrot Fuck (.brf) files into Brainfuck (.bf) files and execute them.

> Note: <br> As this is written in the inferior language python (you cant have the perfect programming language without making some sacrifices), you will need to have it installed to run these scripts.

Run this command to run your Brainrot Fuck program:

```
python brf.py program.brf
```
> Note: <br> Program.brf is the file you are translating and can be any file (as long as it has the .brf extension)

After running this you should see your output in the terminal

# Translating Brainfuck into Brainrot Fuck

To translate your programs made in the inferior Brainfuck language to the superior Brainrot Fuck language run this command:

```
python bfToBrf.py program.bf
```
> Note: <br> Again, program.bf is the file you are translating and can be any file (as long as it has the .bf extension)

A `temp.brf` file will have been created in the same directory.
